# headfirstpytorch
This is inspired after a key book in Java which i have during my growing years in Tech, it is very good it starts with an usecase and then explains the details when the situation arises, on the tutorials i have found online there is no such feeling of adrenaline rush , this is an attempt to create such content, hope you like it.
